## Introduction

A set of tools to simplify the usage of AWS

### Tools

 - `aws-mfa`: A tool to manage MFA session creation, allowing the settings to be saved to a
              configuration file and providing a set of commands to run to utilise the
              created session.
 - `aws-s3-tree`: A tool to query S3 buckets in a user-friendly way.

## Getting started

Install the dependencies:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the commands directly from the `bin/` directory.
